It may not happen during our lives but even the smallest action course help accelerate the destruction of natural resources. <br> <br>
                      No one can fight all the evil in the world, the world needs to be saved little by little. Every action of stopping malicious deeds contributes very much to the end goal. Even though

Saving the tiger means we save the forest since tiger cannot live in places where trees have vanished and in turn secure food and water for all.

                            To make sure that these herbivores live, we must make sure that all the trees, grass and other plants that these prey animals need for food are protected. In this way, the whole forest gets saved! Saving the tiger means saving its entire forest kingdom with all the other animals in it.  If we make sure tigers live, we must make sure that deer, antelope and all other animals that the tiger eats (its prey base) live.

Areas with less trees lead to floods, killing people and destroying homes. It takes away the precious soil, leaving behind a wasteland. The soil jams up our lakes and dams, reducing their ability to store water. By destroying the tiger's home, we not only harm tigers, but also ourselves.

                            The Siberian tiger, also known as the Amur tiger, is the largest subspecies of tiger. Siberian tigers are found primarily in the birch forests of Siberia, eastern Russia, China and North Korea. Siberian tigers are considered an endangered species, and scientists estimate that there are only about 400 to 500 of these cats left in the wild.

                            Unfortunately Siberia is their only natural habitat remaining as they have been destroyed in Asia and Russia over the years. What is very scary is that they are very genetically close to other species of tigers that have already become extinct. This tends to lead one to expect that is the future for them as well.

                           A huge problem for the future of Siberian tigers though due to low numbers is there genetic profile. This particular species has very little variation as it is when it comes to distinctive genetic factors. So when you are also talking about populations out there in the wild that are very closely related you run into even larger problems. Inbreeding can result in offspring that is very poor genetically and this isn’t going to help them with their quest for survival.

                            Tigers are poached for trophies, such as teeth and fur, and for use in traditional medicines.The increase in human population also means that tigers come into contact with farm animals, and farmers sometimes illegally kill the tigers to protect their herds.

                            This is mostly due to human interference. As the human population grows, it needs the materials in the jungles and forests where tigers live. Cutting down trees for wood and harvesting other plants are acts of deforestation that greatly reduce the tigers' habitat. Humans hunt some of the tigers' prey species, which takes food away from dwindling tiger populations. The loss of habitat also leads to a reduction in prey animals, so the area can support fewer tigers.

                           Climate change is dangerous to tigers because it changes the jungles in which the tigers live. As the jungles have difficulty adapting to the changing temperatures, habitats for tigers decrease. Rising sea levels also erode coastal regions, which further encroach upon these habitats.
